                Six Loonies allows you to contribute different kinds of content, which includes
                reviews, photos, questions, answers, private messages, and more. Hence, the quality
                and relevance of our site depends on you. Please read the guidelines below for specific
                types of content that you can contribute to the site.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Inappropriate content:&nbsp;</b>Threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and
                    other displays of bigotry.</li>
                <li><b>Conflicts of interest:&nbsp;</b>Your contributions should be unbiased and objective.
                    For example, businesses and their employees shouldn't write reviews about themselves
                    or their competitors.</li>
                <li><b>Promotional content:&nbsp;</b>Unless you are using adding content to your own
                    professional profile, we do not encourage promotional content. Our intent is to
                    keep the content on the site useful for everyone.</li>
                <li><b>Relevance:&nbsp;</b>Please make sure your contributions are relevant and appropriate
                    to the forum. For example, your reviews should not be used to air your personal
                    grievances or your political ideologies, or other matters that are not related to
                    an end user experience.</li>
                <li><b>Privacy:&nbsp;</b>Don't publicize other people's private information. While some
                    businesses may be identified by the people behind them, you should generally avoid
                    posting other people's full names, personal phone numbers and email addresses —
                    and avoid uploading close-ups of other people without their permission.</li>
                <li><b>Intellectual property:&nbsp;</b>Don't swipe content from other sites. You're
                    a smart cookie, so write your own reviews and take your own photos.</li>
            </ul>

                Reviews
            </div>
            <p>
                The best reviews present their opinions objectively so that it's relevant. You should
                target to offer a substantial level of detail, and a helpful tip or two for other
                people. Here are some additional guidelines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Personal experience:&nbsp;</b>Your review should be based on your own experience,
                    not what you heard from others. Be as specific as you can, while making sure that
                    the review will be useful to others.</li>
                <li><b>Accuracy:&nbsp;</b>Make sure your review is factually correct. It should include
                    your opinions, but it should not exaggerate. We don't take sides when it comes to
                    factual disputes, so we expect you to stand behind your review.</li>
                <li><b>Review updates:&nbsp;</b>Review updates should reflect a new experience or interaction
                    with the professional or business. If you add a new review for a professional or
                    business that you had reviewed earlier, your previous review will be overwritten.
                    We don't promote spam and expect you to not promote spam.</li>

                Questions
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Questions should not be individual opinions</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We recommend that you don’t use the words "you" or "your" in your question; those
                            words suggest that the question is soliciting the opinion of a single person or
                            business. Example: "Do you think that Outdoor parties should have a DJ?" should
                            be written as "Should outdoor parties have a DJ?" because the latter form usually
                            ends up generating better, more useful, answers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Good questions are clearly written</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It should always be clear what your question is asking.</li>
                        <li>A question should make it clear how an answer can meet its expectations. You can
                            use <i>Question Details</i> to provide specific instructions for how answers should
                            be formatted and if they should include any additional information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Good questions have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our policy is that questions should always have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
                            Please do not use short form or slang words in your questions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Good questions provide context and background explanation when appropriate</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In general, your question should include enough context so that most readers understand
                            what's being asked.</li>
                        <li>Question details can be used to provide more explanation and support. This is especially
                            useful for questions about subjects that may be obscure / unknown by many readers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Good questions seek out information rather than arguing a point</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your question should represent a sincere attempt at eliciting good answers and creating
                            a page that is a good, reusable resource on the site.</li>
                        <li>Also, question details should not be used to make an argument, but rather to provide
                            details and background helpful for placing the question in context.</li>

                Answers
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>A good answer should help someone who genuinely wants to know the answer to the
                    question. So, your answer should be truthful, authentic, and correct whenever possible.</li>
                <li>An answer that’s wrong is not a good answer. Answers that are funny, joyful, passionate,
                    will be liked by others. But if the answer is incorrect -- or likely incorrect --
                    then it’s not really helpful.</li>
                <li>A good answer should directly respond to the question. It’s not helpful when you
                    provide an answer that’s a comment or general opinion about the topic, but what
                    you say is not actually an answer.</li>
                <li>A good answer is usually supported with an argument – so that readers can understand
                    why the answer is the answer. Great answers are usually as much about “why?” as
                    they are about “what’s the right answer?” </li>

                Don't be shy — use your professional profile to let people know who you are and
                what makes you tick. Remember that people want to know your story, the kind of services
                you provide, and the specifics of those services. The more meaningful your professional
                profile, the easier it will be for others to find you!</p>

                You can upload photos and videos to your professional profile. Photos, and videos
                that best reflect the types of services you provide along with an appropriate description
                will help you build a profile that is engaging and interesting with its readers.<br />
