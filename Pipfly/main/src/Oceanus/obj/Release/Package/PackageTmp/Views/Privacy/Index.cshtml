                    <li><b>Account information:&nbsp;</b>We ask for and store information about you when
                        you create an account on the Site, such as your name, email address, and location.
                        You can also import your account information from a third party (e.g. Facebook)
                        to make the Pipfly registration process easier. We use your name to create
                        your account name (first name and last initial) and we use your location to help
                        target the Site to the town you live in. We use your email address to send you updates,
                        provide services to you in connection with the Site, and to contact you on behalf
                        of other users or professionals / businesses sending you messages, complements,
                        and the like. We may also use your signup location, birth date, and gender (if you
                        supply them) to display relevant advertising to you.</li>
                    <li><b>Public content:&nbsp;</b>You can contribute to the Site in a number of different
                        ways, including clipping photos, videos and articles from the web, uploading photos/videos/audio files, 
                        authoring your own articles, participating
                        in talk threads, sending compliments, filling out your public profile, voting on
                        other users' contributions, inviting your Facebook friends and other users on the
                        site to your network on Pipfly, and any other public content. We may store these contributions (your
                        "Public Content"), display them to other users, and use them for promotional purposes.
                        Note that if you include personally identifiable information in your Public Content,
                        it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information
                        you choose to include in your Public Content. The site will store any public information
                        you contributed and will be used to display this content when you any other user
                        of the site visits the site.</li>
                    <li><b>Messaging:&nbsp;</b>Pipfly allows you to exchange messages with others using
                        the messaging feature and email. We may store these messages in order to deliver
                        them and allow you to manage them. Pipfly
                        reserves the right to scrutinize or remove any messaging considered inappropriate
                        by the site and/or its users.</li>
                    <li><b>Inviting friends:&nbsp;</b>You can invite your friends to join the Site by providing
                        their contact information, or by entering your log-in credentials to import your
                        address book from other sites (e.g. Facebook). We may store and use your friends'
                        contact information to invite them to join and connect with you on the Site. Your
                        friends will always have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving further emails
                        from us.</li>
                    <li><b>Third party services:&nbsp;</b>We allow you to access third party services, such
                        as Facebook and Twitter, to share your selected Public Content with those services,
                        and import information about who you are connected with on those other services
                        so you can connect with them on the Site. You can always opt out on your Six Loonies
                        account page. Some of those third party services may also provide us with information
                        from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of this Site. For example,
                        you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow
                        their activity on Pipfly. You can also further modify your privacy settings
                        with those other services directly. For example, you can adjust your privacy setting
                        on Facebook to prevent your Facebook friends from sharing information about you
                        from their Facebook accounts with Pipfly.</li>
                    <li><b>Activity and log data:&nbsp;</b>We automatically store information related to
                        your use of the Site, such as the pages you view on the Site, your browser type,
                        IP address, the phone numbers and names of businesses that you connect with through
                        the Site, requested URL, browser language, referring URL, and the date and time
                        of your visit. We use this type of information to administer the Site and provide
                        the highest possible level of service to you. We also use this information in the
                        aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in
                        order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Site.</li>
                    <li><b>Cookies:&nbsp;</b>We send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify
                        your browser and improve the quality of our service. "Cookies" refer to small pieces
                        of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are
                        viewing the Site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your
                        browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
                        Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser help file directions.
                        If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site may not work properly or
                        at all. Our cookies are linked to your information, such as your name, email address
                        and password. We enable some of our business partners to use cookies in conjunction
                        with your use of the Site. We have no access to or control over the use of these
                        cookies. These cookies collect information about your use of the Site, such as where
                        you came from, which pages you visited within the Site, and possibly other sites
                        you visit if those sites cooperate with the same third party, but do not collect
                        your name, email address, contact information or other personally identifiable information
                        that by itself would allow the third party to identify or contact you.</li>
                    <li><b>Feedback:&nbsp;</b>You should feel free to give us feedback, register a complaint,
                        or ask questions about the Site. We may store your communications, including any
                        personal information you include in them, so that we can effectively respond to

                    <li><b>Administration:&nbsp;</b>We may use the information described above for routine
                        administrative purposes, such as investigating abuses on the Site, responding to
                        user inquiries and enforcing and applying our Terms of Service and Statement. Pipfly
                        reserves the right to edit, change, modify or remove any user submitted content,
                        messages or any communication consider inappropriate or unpalatable by any stakeholder
                        or user of the site without any communication to the submitter.</li>

                    When and Why Six Loonies Discloses Personal Information
                </div>
                <p>
                    We will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties except to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pipfly business partners or advertisers, as part of an offer, contest, or other
                        activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Pipfly and its business
                        partners and in which you have elected to participate. For example, if you are referred
                        to Six Loonies from a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated
                        by or in conjunction with a Six Loonies business partner, Six Loonies may provide
                        that business partner with Contact Information and Transactional Information to
                        validate the referral and to support the terms of the relationship between Six Loonies
                        and the business partner, which may allow such business partner to contact you directly
                        and to advertise to you.</li>
                    <li>Effect a merger, acquisition, or otherwise; to support the sale or transfer of business

                        to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions. We may also
                        disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory
                        action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena,
                        or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and
                        courts in the United States and other countries where we operate. If Pipfly
                        is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
                        you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Site of any change
                        in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may
                        have regarding your Personal Information.</li>
                    <li>We encourage Pipfly's business partners to adopt and post privacy
                        policies. However, the use of your Personal Information by such parties is governed
                        by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</li>

                </div>
                <p>
                    When you use our Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic
                    means, using technologies such as cookies, browser analysis tools, and web server
                    logs. As you use our Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate
                    with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate
                    and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs
                    and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then
                    transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers
                    are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service
                    providers.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    For example, when you visit our Site, Pipfly and our service providers may
                    place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize
                    you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized
                    experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect
                    certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server
                    sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences,
                    and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to
                    connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile
                    or as related to your interactions with the Sites.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. “Session"
                    cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.
                    Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent"
                    cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices
                    even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of
                    purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such
                    as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.
                    For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Sites,
                    your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other
                    system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time
                    zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers.
                    Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of the devices
                    you use to interact with the Sites. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices
                    use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect
                    information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Site and
                    the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied
                    to us by your browser.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used
                    in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example,
                    we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Sites and understand
                    its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we
                    collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that
                    case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that information.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive

                    Pipfly may have relationships with third party advertising companies to place
                    advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting
                    functions for our Sites and our advertisements. We do not share Personal Information
                    with third party advertising companies; however, these third parties may automatically
                    collect information about your visit to our Sites and other websites, your IP address,
                    your ISP and the browser you use to visit this Site. They do this by using cookies,
                    clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other
                    things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand
                    the usage and visitation of our Site and the other websites tracked by these third
                    parties. This Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of
                    the information collected by these third parties, and Pipfly is not responsible
                    for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy
                    policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more

                    This Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Pipfly
                    through your interaction with the Sites. Other websites that may be accessible

                    information collection, use, and disclosure practices. Our merchants and business
                    partners may have their own privacy statements, too. We encourage you to familiarize
                    yourself with the privacy statements provided by these other parties prior to providing

                    Our Sites may contain Communities and other areas where you may be able to publicly
                    post information, communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, review
                    products and merchants, and submit media content. Prior to posting in these areas,
                    please read our Terms of Use carefully. All the information you post will be accessible
                    to anyone with Internet access, and any Personal Information you include in your
                    posting may be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post your
                    email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive unsolicited
                    messages from other parties. Please avoid publicly posting Personal Information.</p>
